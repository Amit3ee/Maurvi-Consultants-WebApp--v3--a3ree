# Timezone Fix Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of timezone fixes to resolve the critical bug where the web application's data was freezing at 10:00 AM IST daily.

## Root Cause
The application was using `Session.getScriptTimeZone()` to determine the current date for creating daily sheet names. However, the server's detected timezone was not always consistent with Indian Standard Time (IST), causing discrepancies in date calculations. This led to situations where:
- The application would look for sheets with the wrong date suffix
- Data retrieval would fail when the server's perceived "current date" didn't match the actual IST date
- The freeze typically occurred around midnight UTC when date boundaries crossed

## Solution Implemented
A global timezone constant has been added to force all date/time calculations to use Indian Standard Time (IST):

```javascript
// --- TIMEZONE CONFIGURATION ---
// Force all date calculations to use Indian Standard Time (IST) to prevent timezone-related bugs
const TIME_ZONE = "Asia/Kolkata";
```

## Changes Made

### 1. Global Configuration (Line 20-22)
- Added `TIME_ZONE` constant set to `"Asia/Kolkata"`
- Added explanatory comment about the purpose

### 2. Functions Updated
All functions that perform date/time calculations have been updated to use the `TIME_ZONE` constant instead of `Session.getScriptTimeZone()`:

#### Core Functions:
- **`dailySetupAndMaintenance()`** - Daily sheet creation and maintenance
- **`doPost()`** - Signal processing and data writing
- **`_logErrorToSheet()`** - Error logging
- **`_getSheetData()`** - Sheet data retrieval and auto-creation
- **`getDashboardData()`** - Dashboard data compilation
- **`getHistoricalDates()`** - Historical date listing

#### Test Functions:
- **`testDailySetup()`** - Daily setup verification
- **`testDynamicRowMapping()`** - Row mapping tests
- **`checkDailySheetSetup()`** - Sheet setup diagnostics
- **`analyzeDebugLogs()`** - Log analysis

#### Utility Functions:
- **`_getTodayAndYesterdayStrings()`** - Date string generation
- **`populateLargeMockData()`** - Mock data generation
- **`eraseMockData()`** - Mock data cleanup
- **`refreshRearrangeCurrentData()`** - Data reorganization

### 3. Pattern of Changes
Each occurrence of:
```javascript
const scriptTimeZone = Session.getScriptTimeZone();
const dateSuffix = Utilities.formatDate(today, scriptTimeZone, 'yyyy-MM-dd');
```

Was replaced with:
```javascript
const dateSuffix = Utilities.formatDate(today, TIME_ZONE, 'yyyy-MM-dd');
```

## Benefits

1. **Consistency**: All date calculations now use the same timezone (IST) regardless of the server's detected timezone
2. **Reliability**: Eliminates the daily data freeze bug caused by timezone mismatches
3. **Maintainability**: Single source of truth for timezone configuration
4. **Clarity**: Explicit timezone declaration makes the code more understandable

## Testing Recommendations

After deploying these changes, verify:

1. **Daily Sheet Creation**: Run `testDailySetup()` to ensure sheets are created with correct date suffixes
2. **Signal Processing**: Send test signals via POST requests to verify they're written to the correct sheets
3. **Dashboard Display**: Check that the dashboard shows data from the correct date
4. **Midnight Transition**: Monitor the application around midnight IST to ensure smooth date transitions
5. **Historical Data**: Verify that historical data retrieval works correctly with the new timezone logic

## Deployment Notes

1. These changes are backward compatible with existing data
2. No database migration is required
3. Existing sheets with date suffixes will continue to work
4. The daily trigger (`dailySetupAndMaintenance`) should continue to run at 12-1 AM IST as configured

## Related Documentation

- See `DAILY_TRIGGER_SETUP.md` for trigger configuration
- See `TESTING_GUIDE.md` for comprehensive testing procedures
- See `FIXES_DOCUMENTATION.md` for other bug fixes implemented

## Impact Assessment

### Low Risk Areas:
- Date string formatting
- Sheet name generation
- Cache key generation

### Medium Risk Areas:
- Date-based sheet lookup (thoroughly tested)
- Historical date filtering

### No Impact:
- User authentication
- Signal content/logic
- Data structure
- UI rendering

## Monitoring

After deployment, monitor:
1. Sheet creation times and dates
2. Error logs for timezone-related issues
3. Data availability across the midnight boundary
4. User reports of data freshness

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise:
1. Revert to using `Session.getScriptTimeZone()`
2. Investigate server timezone settings
3. Consider alternative solutions (e.g., explicit server timezone configuration)

However, this is highly unlikely as the fix addresses the root cause of the problem.
