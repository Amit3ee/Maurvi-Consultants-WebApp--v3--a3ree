# Fixes Documentation

This document provides detailed information about the fixes implemented for the 8 reported issues.

## Issue 1: Social Login Integration

### Problem
Social login buttons showed placeholder messages:
- "Google Sign-In integration coming soon. Please use guest login for now."
- "Microsoft Sign-In integration coming soon. Please use guest login for now."
- "Apple Sign-In integration coming soon. Please use guest login for now."

### Solution
Implemented full OAuth integration for all three providers:

#### Google Sign-In
- Added Google Identity Services SDK
- Implemented One Tap sign-in prompt
- JWT token decoding for user information
- Proper error handling and fallback

#### Microsoft Sign-In
- Integrated Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) 2.38.1
- Popup-based authentication flow
- Account information extraction
- User cancellation handling

#### Apple Sign-In
- Added Apple Sign-In JS SDK
- Popup-based authentication
- ID token decoding
- User name handling from Apple's limited API

### Configuration Required
Before deployment, update these values in `index.html`:

```javascript
// Google Sign-In
client_id: 'YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID.apps.googleusercontent.com'

// Microsoft Sign-In
clientId: 'YOUR_MICROSOFT_CLIENT_ID'

// Apple Sign-In
clientId: 'YOUR_APPLE_SERVICE_ID'
```

### Setup Instructions

#### Google OAuth Setup
1. Go to https://console.cloud.google.com/
2. Create a new project or select existing
3. Enable "Google Sign-In API"
4. Go to "Credentials" → "Create Credentials" → "OAuth 2.0 Client ID"
5. Application type: "Web application"
6. Add authorized JavaScript origins: Your web app URL
7. Add authorized redirect URIs: Your web app URL
8. Copy the Client ID

#### Microsoft OAuth Setup
1. Go to https://portal.azure.com/
2. Navigate to "Azure Active Directory" → "App registrations"
3. Click "New registration"
4. Name: "Trading Signals App"
5. Supported account types: "Accounts in any organizational directory and personal Microsoft accounts"
6. Redirect URI: "Single-page application (SPA)" with your web app URL
7. Copy the Application (client) ID

#### Apple Sign-In Setup
1. Go to https://developer.apple.com/account/
2. Navigate to "Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles"
3. Click "Identifiers" → "+" → "Services IDs"
4. Register a new Service ID
5. Enable "Sign in with Apple"
6. Configure domains and return URLs
7. Copy the Service ID

## Issue 2: Approval Request Email with Inline Buttons

### Problem
Admin had to manually run `approveUser()` function in Apps Script to approve new users.

### Solution
- Enhanced `doGet()` handler to process approval/rejection URLs
- Added `handleApprovalRequest()` function for direct email-based approvals
- Updated email template with styled approve/reject buttons
- Automatic email notifications to users on approval/rejection

### Email Features
- **Approve Button**: Green button that approves user and grants access
- **Reject Button**: Red button that removes user and notifies them
- One-click operation directly from Gmail
- Beautiful HTML email template with proper styling
- Success/error pages displayed after button click

### How It Works
1. User registers via social login
2. Admin receives email with approve/reject buttons
3. Admin clicks button in Gmail
4. Action executes immediately (no Apps Script editor needed)
5. User receives confirmation email
6. Result page displays success/error message

## Issue 3: Lock Timeout Error

### Problem
Error: "Exception: Lock timeout: another process was holding the lock for too long."

### Solution
- Increased lock timeout from 30 seconds to 60 seconds
- Changed `lock.waitLock(30000)` to `lock.waitLock(60000)` in `doPost()` function
- Maintains data integrity during concurrent webhook requests
- No impact on data reflection speed (still uses 30-second cache)

### Impact
- Handles higher webhook traffic volumes
- Prevents timeout errors during peak loads
- Data continues to reflect without lag

## Issue 4: Glowing Effect Location

### Problem
Glowing effect appeared in Live Feed but should appear in Dashboard Sync Signal Feed.

### Solution
- Added glow class logic to `renderDashboardSignals()` function
- Removed glow class from `renderLiveFeed()` function
- Glow now only appears on Dashboard tab for synced signals

### Implementation
```javascript
const getGlowClass = (syncReason) => {
    if (!syncReason) return '';
    const r = syncReason.toLowerCase();
    if (r.includes('hvd') || r.includes('significant deployed capital')) 
        return 'card-glow-hvd';
    if (r.includes('oversold')) return 'card-glow-oversold';
    if (r.includes('overbought')) return 'card-glow-overbought';
    return '';
};
```

## Issue 5: Glowing Effect Animation & Color Differentiation

### Problem
- No animation on glowing effect
- No color difference for different sync reasons

### Solution
Added three distinct animated glow effects:

#### CSS Animations
```css
@keyframes glow-pulse-orange { ... }  /* HVD */
@keyframes glow-pulse-blue { ... }    /* Oversold */
@keyframes glow-pulse-purple { ... }  /* Overbought */
```

### Color Mapping
| Sync Reason | Color | Animation | Use Case |
|-------------|-------|-----------|----------|
| HVD / Significant Deployed Capital | Orange | 2.5s pulse | High volume deployment |
| Oversold | Blue | 2.5s pulse | RSI/momentum oversold |
| Overbought | Purple | 2.5s pulse | RSI/momentum overbought |

### Features
- Smooth pulsing animation (2.5s cycle)
- Pauses on hover for better UX
- Enhanced box-shadow on hover
- Border color matching glow color

## Issue 6: Sync Signals Feed Filtering

### Problem
Logs section showed all Indicator2 signals, including non-synced ones.

### Solution
- Updated `getDashboardData()` function in `code.gs`
- Added sync validation before adding signals to logs
- Only signals that exist in Indicator1 sheet sync columns are shown
- Added logging for skipped non-synced signals

### Logic
```javascript
// Check if signal is synced with Indicator1
let isSynced = false;
if (ind1Row) {
    // Check if time matches any sync time in columns L onwards
    for (let j = 12; j < 53; j += 2) {
        if (ind1Row[j] && ind1Row[j] === time) {
            isSynced = true;
            break;
        }
    }
}

// Only add to logs if synced
if (!isSynced) return;
```

### Impact
- Logs tab shows only truly synced signals
- Cleaner, more accurate data display
- Easier to identify real sync events

## Issue 7: Refresh/Rearrange Function

### Problem
Need function to fix data written wrongly on current date sheet.

### Solution
Added `refreshRearrangeCurrentData()` function with:

### Features
- Reads all data from current Indicator1 sheet
- Builds clean symbol map with deduplicated data
- Clears sheet and rewrites organized data
- Rebuilds symbol row cache
- Maintains up to 5 Indicator1 signals per symbol
- Maintains up to 21 Indicator2 sync events per symbol

### Usage
Run manually from Apps Script editor:
```javascript
refreshRearrangeCurrentData()
```

### What It Fixes
- Duplicate symbol entries
- Wrongly positioned data
- Corrupted row mappings
- Cache inconsistencies

### Output
Returns status object:
```javascript
{
    status: 'success',
    message: 'Data refreshed and rearranged successfully!\n
             - Unique symbols: 45\n
             - Total Indicator1 signals: 123\n
             - Total Indicator2 sync events: 89'
}
```

## Issue 8: Narration Not Working

### Problem
Voice narration not functioning when enabled.

### Solution
Enhanced voice loading and speech synthesis:

### Fixed Issues
1. **Voice Loading**: Added retry logic with delays
2. **Voice Initialization**: Proper onvoiceschanged handler
3. **Voice Selection**: Enhanced priority-based selection
4. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive logging and fallbacks

### Voice Priority
1. Indian English female voice (en-IN, female)
2. Any Indian English voice (en-IN)
3. Any English female voice (en-*)
4. Google English voice
5. System default with en-IN forced

### Implementation
```javascript
function loadSpeechVoices() {
    const setVoices = () => { 
        AppState.speechVoices = window.speechSynthesis.getVoices(); 
        console.log("Voices loaded:", AppState.speechVoices.length); 
    };
    
    // Set handler
    if (window.speechSynthesis.onvoiceschanged !== undefined) {
        window.speechSynthesis.onvoiceschanged = setVoices;
    }
    
    // Load immediately
    setVoices();
    
    // Retry if needed
    if (AppState.speechVoices.length === 0) {
        setTimeout(setVoices, 100);
    }
}
```

### Features
- Detailed console logging for debugging
- Proper error events (onerror, onend)
- Cancellation of previous speech
- Retry mechanism for voice loading
- Graceful fallbacks
