# Quick Reference: Issues Fixed and Solutions Implemented

## Summary of Issues and Fixes

### Issue 1: Indicator1_Date Rows with No Indicator1 Reason ❌ FALSE ALARM
**Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED - No actual issue found**

**Analysis**:
- Analyzed the provided `Indicator1_2025-10-27.txt` file
- Found **0 rows** with symbols but no Indicator1 reasons
- All 262 rows either have a symbol with reasons OR are empty rows

**Existing Protection**:
The code already has proper logic (lines 428-470) to prevent this:
- Only Indicator1 signals can create new rows
- Indicator2 signals for non-existent symbols are stored in Indicator2 sheet only
- This prevents rows with blank Indicator1 reasons

**Enhancements Made**:
- Added detailed comments explaining the logic
- Enhanced validation messages for clarity
- Improved logging to track this scenario

### Issue 2: Debug Sheet Lock Timeout Errors ✅ FIXED
**Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED**

**Problem**:
- 45 lock timeout errors in `DebugLogs_2025-10-27.txt`
- Occurred when multiple TradingView alerts arrived simultaneously
- Previous timeout: 60 seconds

**Root Cause**:
- High concurrent alert volume during market hours
- Multiple processes competing for the same lock
- Insufficient timeout and no retry mechanism

**Solutions Implemented**:

1. **Increased Lock Timeout**
   - Changed from 60 seconds to **120 seconds**
   - Allows more time for queued requests to process
   
2. **Added Retry Logic**
   - Up to **3 retry attempts** with exponential backoff
   - Backoff timing: 1s, 2s, 4s between retries
   - Automatically handles transient lock contention
   
3. **Enhanced Error Handling**
   - Detailed error types: `lock_timeout`, `processing_error`
   - Retryable flag for TradingView to know when to retry
   - Better error context in logs
   
4. **Improved Logging**
   - Error context includes timestamp, error type, received data
   - Structured error logging for easier analysis
   
5. **Added Diagnostic Tools**
   - `analyzeDebugLogs()` function to analyze error patterns
   - Identifies peak error times, affected symbols, error types
   - Helps with capacity planning

**Code Changes**:
```javascript
// Lock acquisition with retry (code.gs lines 321-340)
let lockAcquired = false;
let retryCount = 0;
const maxRetries = 3;
const lockTimeout = 120000; // 120 seconds

while (!lockAcquired && retryCount < maxRetries) {
  try {
    lock.waitLock(lockTimeout);
    lockAcquired = true;
  } catch (lockErr) {
    retryCount++;
    if (retryCount >= maxRetries) {
      throw new Error(`Failed to acquire lock after ${maxRetries} retries`);
    }
    // Exponential backoff: wait 1s, 2s, 4s
    Utilities.sleep(Math.pow(2, retryCount - 1) * 1000);
  }
}
```

**Documentation**:
- Created `LOCK_TIMEOUT_TROUBLESHOOTING.md` (9KB comprehensive guide)
- Covers monitoring, prevention, recovery, and optimization
- Includes best practices for TradingView alert configuration

### Issue 3: Daily Sheets Not Auto-Creating ✅ DOCUMENTED
**Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED - Setup Required**

**Problem**:
- Daily sheets (`Indicator1_YYYY-MM-DD`, etc.) not creating automatically
- Function `dailySetupAndMaintenance()` exists but not triggered

**Root Cause**:
- No time-based trigger configured in Apps Script
- User needs to set up trigger manually (one-time setup)

**Solution**:
The function already exists and works correctly. User needs to:
1. Set up a time-based trigger in Apps Script
2. Configure it to run `dailySetupAndMaintenance()` daily at midnight

**Documentation Created**:
- `DAILY_TRIGGER_SETUP.md` (5KB step-by-step guide)
- Covers:
  - How to create time-based triggers
  - Recommended timing (midnight to 1am)
  - Authorization process
  - Testing and verification
  - Troubleshooting common issues
  - Monitoring and maintenance

**Diagnostic Tools Added**:
- `checkDailySheetSetup()` function to verify sheets exist
- Checks for today's sheets, old sheets (for purging), and cache status
- Provides detailed status report

**What the Function Does**:
1. Creates 3 date-suffixed sheets for today:
   - `Indicator1_YYYY-MM-DD`
   - `Indicator2_YYYY-MM-DD`
   - `DebugLogs_YYYY-MM-DD`
2. Adds proper headers to each sheet
3. Deletes sheets older than 14 days
4. Clears cache for the new day
5. Logs all actions for verification

**Manual Trigger Setup**:
```
1. Extensions > Apps Script
2. Click Triggers (clock icon)
3. Add Trigger:
   - Function: dailySetupAndMaintenance
   - Event: Time-driven
   - Type: Day timer
   - Time: Midnight to 1am
4. Save and authorize
```

## Testing and Verification

### To Test Lock Timeout Fixes:
1. Monitor `DebugLogs_YYYY-MM-DD` sheet during trading hours
2. Run `analyzeDebugLogs()` at end of day
3. Compare lock timeout frequency before and after
4. Expected: Significant reduction in lock timeout errors

### To Test Daily Sheet Creation:
1. Set up time-based trigger (see DAILY_TRIGGER_SETUP.md)
2. Wait until trigger time (or run manually)
3. Run `checkDailySheetSetup()` to verify
4. Expected: All 3 sheets created with proper headers

### To Verify Indicator1 Logic:
1. Send Indicator2 alert for a symbol not in Indicator1 sheet
2. Check Indicator1 sheet - should NOT create a row
3. Check Indicator2 sheet - should have the signal recorded
4. Expected: No rows with blank Indicator1 reasons

---

## Best Practices Going Forward

### 1. Monitor Daily
- Review `DebugLogs_YYYY-MM-DD` sheet for errors
- Run `analyzeDebugLogs()` to check patterns
- Verify lock timeout frequency is acceptable (<5% of requests)

### 2. TradingView Alert Configuration
- Space out alerts by 5-10 seconds per symbol
- Avoid triggering multiple alerts simultaneously
- Use different webhooks for high/low priority signals

### 3. Sheet Maintenance
- Verify daily sheets are created automatically
- Check old sheets are purged after 14 days
- Run `refreshRearrangeCurrentData()` if data gets messy

### 4. Capacity Planning
- Current capacity: ~100 concurrent requests with retry logic
- If exceeding capacity, consider:
  - Splitting alerts across multiple sheet instances
  - Implementing webhook queuing
  - Using database alternative (Cloud SQL, Firestore)
