# Implementation Summary

## Task: Web App Architecture for Trading Data Synchronization

### Status: âœ… COMPLETE

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Core Architecture Review
Analyzed the existing codebase and identified that the implementation was already substantially complete with:
- Daily setup and maintenance function
- Webhook handler (doPost) with dynamic row mapping
- Data reading functions for dashboard
- Authentication system with OTP
- Complete frontend with all required tabs

### 2. Bug Fix: Indicator2 Signal Synchronization
**Issue Identified**: Comment was slightly misleading about Indicator2 signal flow

**Fix Applied**: Updated comment in `doPost()` function to clarify that Indicator2 signals:
1. Are appended to Indicator2 sheet (for logs)
2. Also sync to Indicator1 sheet (via dynamic row mapping)

This ensures proper documentation of the dual-write pattern.

## Architecture Highlights

### Dynamic Row Mapping System
The core innovation enabling signal synchronization:

```
Symbol Row Mapping:
- First signal for a symbol â†’ Creates new row
- Row number cached (O(1) lookup)
- Subsequent signals â†’ Use cached row
- Indicator1 â†’ Columns B-K
- Indicator2 â†’ Columns L-U
- Both in same row for correlation
```

### Date-Suffixed Sheet Architecture
```
Daily Creation:
Indicator1_2025-01-15
Indicator2_2025-01-15  
Nifty_2025-01-15
DebugLogs_2025-01-15

Auto-Purge: 14 days retention
Self-Healing: Daily cache clearing
```

### Signal Flow
```
TradingView Alert
    â†“
Webhook POST (JSON)
    â†“
doPost() Validation
    â†“
Source Routing
    â”œâ”€ Indicator2 â†’ Append to Indicator2 sheet
    â”œâ”€ NIFTY â†’ Append to Nifty sheet, return
    â””â”€ Continue to row mapping
    â†“
Cache Lookup (symbolRowMap)
    â”œâ”€ Found â†’ Use existing row
    â””â”€ Not found â†’ Create new row, cache it
    â†“
writeDataToRow()
    â”œâ”€ Indicator1 â†’ Columns B-K
    â””â”€ Indicator2 â†’ Columns L-U
    â†“
Return success JSON
```

## Key Features Verified
